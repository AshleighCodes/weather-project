# Plus Resources: Weather Project
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Tests-Passing-greeb)


## TODO
- [x] Implement the methods in `weather.py`.
- [x] Verify that everything works as intended by running the tests with `python3 run_tests.py` (Mac users), or `python3 run_tests.py` (PC users).


## CHALLENGES
As a beginner, I found it challenging to understand and handle error messages in Python, and how to start when completing each question. Figuring out what the errors meant and how to fix them took some time, but it was a valuable learning experience that helped me become more comfortable with debugging my code.


## ACHIEVEMENTS
One of my biggest accomplishments in this assignment was successfully implementing the convert_f_to_c function in the final two questions. It felt great to see everything work as expected after understanding how to properly convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Massive shout-out goes to Maddie (Brisbane Python Mentor), who helped me get through those final two questions.


## LEARNINGS
Although I'm not an expert in Python, the biggest learning for me was the importance of never being afraid to ask for help. Asking for help, no matter how big or small the problem, can be really beneficial in the long run!
